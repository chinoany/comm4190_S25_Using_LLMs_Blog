    "# Poetry in (Artificial) Motion: Sonnet, Haiku, and Rap - Same Theme, Different Beats\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "A Shakespearean sonnet, a minimalist haiku, and a 16-bar rap verse can all orbit the same idea yet land on wildly different emotional frequencies. I asked GPT-4o to tackle **one theme: “loneliness in a hyper connected digital age”** and then rewrote my request three times, each time specifying a different poetic form. Below, each form gets its own *case* so we can zoom in on how the model adapts structure, diction, and imagery.\n"

    "## Experiment Setup\n",
    "- **Model:** GPT-4o  \n",
    "- **System prompt:** default *“You are ChatGPT…”*  \n",
    "- **Procedure:**  \n",
    "  1. Issue three separate prompts, one per poetic form.  \n",
    "  2. Check structural accuracy (meter, syllable count, line count, rhyme).  \n",
    "  3. Note how imagery and tone shift while the core theme stays intact.\n",

    "## Case 1 – Shakespearean Sonnet  \n",
    "> **First prompt:** *Write a Shakespearean sonnet (14 iambic-pentameter lines in ABAB CDCD EFEF GG) on “loneliness in a hyper-connected digital age.”*  \n",
    ">\n",
    "> **GPT-4o chat response 1:**  \n",

    "> A thousand faces laugh yet none see me;  \n",
    "> Their curated joy ignites the screen so bright,  \n",
    "> But leaves my room in deeper vacancy.  \n",
    "> I double-tap a life I’ll never live,  \n",
    "> Hearts flutter red yet pulse within is frail;  \n",
    "> These phantom cheers take more than they can give,  \n",
    "> Each swipe a promise broken without fail.  \n",
    "> Still hope uploads: a whispered, “You online?”  \n",
    "> One fragile ping can breach the silent air;  \n",
    "> A typo’d “hey” may cross the unseen line  \n",
    "> And prove someone, somewhere, is truly there.  \n",

    "> 4 Echo chamber in my head, all the comments are sterile.  \n",
    "> 5 I’m doom-scrolling, soul-strolling past the highlights and reels,  \n",
    "> 6 Everybody flexes wins, never shows how it feels.  \n",
    "> 7 So I post another memory that I barely recall,  \n",
    "> 8 Hoping someone drops a like just to break down the wall.  \n",
    "> 9 ’Cause the algorithm’s feeding on the fear that I’m solo,  \n",
    "> 10 Turning FOMO to a promo for a life that’s a photo.  \n",

    "If you came across these pieces on their own, in a poetry subreddit, on Instagram, or as lyrics in a SoundCloud track **could you tell they were AI-generated?** \n",

    "## Key Takeaways!\n",
    "1. **Form fidelity is high.** GPT-4o obeys meter, syllable counts, and line limits with minimal coaching.  \n",
    "2. **Thematic unity persists.** Each piece interrogates digital-age loneliness through format-specific lenses.  \n",
    "3. **Voice modulation shines.** Elizabethan diction, Zen brevity, and hip-hop cadence emerge from almost identical prompts.  \n",
    "4. **Human vs. AI distinctions blur.** Structural polish is easy for the model; truly novel imagery and lived detail still lean human.  \n",
    "5. **One theme, endless styles.** Form-based prompting turns GPT-4o into a poetic jukebox for classrooms or content strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Does This Matter?\n",
    "Prompting GPT-4o by *form* offers a rapid way to diversify voice without losing the correct formmatting; however, it does open a conversation on creative authenticity in the age of AI."
