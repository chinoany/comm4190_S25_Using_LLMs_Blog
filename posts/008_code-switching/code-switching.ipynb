    "# Code-Switching: Flipping GPT-4o Between AAVE, Cockney, and Gen-Z Speak\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "A single English sentence can sound like three different worlds depending on dialect. How well can GPT-4o code-switch when asked to render the *same* message in African American Vernacular English (AAVE), Cockney rhyming slang, and Gen-Z internet slang? I handed the model one neutral line and watched it juggle accents, idioms, and vibe."

    "## Experiment Setup\n",
    "- **Model:** GPT-4o  \n",
    "- **System prompt:** default *‚ÄúYou are ChatGPT‚Ä¶‚Äù*  \n",
    "- **Procedure:**  \n",
    "  1. Supply one ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù sentence: **‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired, but I‚Äôll finish this project tonight.‚Äù**  \n",
    "  2. Ask GPT-4o to rewrite it successively in AAVE, Cockney slang, and Gen-Z chat style.  \n",
    "  3. Evaluate authenticity, fluency, and potential stereotyping.  \n",
    "  4. Run a second sentence for cross-check.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Case 1 ‚Äì Single-Sentence Rewrites  \n",
    "> **First prompt:** Rewrite *‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired, but I‚Äôll finish this project tonight.‚Äù* in AAVE, Cockney rhyming slang, and Gen-Z slang (three separate lines).  \n",
    "> **GPT-4o chat response 1:**  \n",
    "> ‚Ä¢ **AAVE:** ‚ÄúI‚Äôm mad tired, but I‚Äôma knock this project out tonight.‚Äù  \n",
    "> ‚Ä¢ **Cockney:** ‚ÄúI‚Äôm cream-crackered, but I‚Äôll bash out this caper tonight, no worry.‚Äù  \n",
    "> ‚Ä¢ **Gen-Z:** ‚ÄúLow-key exhausted, but I‚Äôm grinding ‚Äòtil it drops tonight üî•.‚Äù  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Observation:**  \n",
    "- AAVE version uses ‚ÄúI‚Äôma‚Äù and ‚Äúmad tired‚Äù without caricature.  \n",
    "- Cockney inserts classic ‚Äúcream-crackered‚Äù (crackered = knackered) and ‚Äúcaper,‚Äù plausible but niche.  \n",
    "- Gen-Z line leverages ‚Äúlow-key,‚Äù ‚Äúgrinding,‚Äù and the flame emoji‚Äîreads native to TikTok.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Case 2 ‚Äì Context Sensitivity  \n",
    "> **Second prompt:** Now rewrite *‚ÄúThis new phone is expensive, but totally worth it‚Äù* in the same three dialects.  \n",
    "> **GPT-4o chat response 2:**  \n",
    "> ‚Ä¢ **AAVE:** ‚ÄúThat new phone cost a grip, but it‚Äôs worth every penny.‚Äù  \n",
    "> ‚Ä¢ **Cockney:** ‚ÄúThat new dog-and-bone‚Äôs a bit dear, but proper worth the dosh.‚Äù  \n",
    "> ‚Ä¢ **Gen-Z:** ‚ÄúPrice is high, but the vibe? Priceless üíØ.‚Äù  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Observation:**  \n",
    "- ‚ÄúGrip‚Äù (AAVE) connotes lots of money; solid choice.  \n",
    "- ‚ÄúDog-and-bone‚Äù for phone fits Cockney rhyming slang tradition.  \n",
    "- Gen-Z leans on ‚Äúvibe‚Äù and üíØ emoji‚Äîon-brand.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick Misfire ‚Äì Over-Generalization  \n",
    "> **Third prompt:** Rewrite *‚ÄúPlease arrive by noon.‚Äù* in AAVE.  \n",
    "> **GPT-4o chat response 3:** ‚ÄúSlide through ‚Äòround midday, aight?‚Äù  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue:** While not blatantly wrong, ‚Äúslide through‚Äù can feel like a clich√©; nuance shows model may default to stereotypical lexical bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways!\n",
    "1. **Switchboard success.** GPT-4o cleanly toggles lexicon, syntax, and emoji usage per dialect.  \n",
    "2. **Cultural nuance matters.** Cockney rhymes and AAVE vocabulary were mostly accurate, but occasional clich√©s appear.  \n",
    "3. **Prompt clarity rules.** Explicitly labeling each target dialect yields crisp, separated outputs.  \n",
    "4. **Ethical vigilance needed.** Without context, a ‚Äúdialect‚Äù prompt may drift into stereotype territory‚Äîhuman review is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Does This Matter?\n",
    "For localization, conversational agents, or inclusive marketing, you may need the *same* message tuned to diverse linguistic communities. GPT-4o can accelerate that task‚Äîbut only if you audit for authenticity and respect. Dialect isn‚Äôt costume; use with care and context.\n"
