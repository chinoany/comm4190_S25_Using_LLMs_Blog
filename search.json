    "text": "ChatGPT and other language models are incredibly skilled at producing human-like text, but how well do they perform when it comes to processing idiomatic language? Idioms‚Äîphrases where meaning is not directly derived from their constituent words‚Äîchallenge the mettle of AI. Idioms require cultural and contextual knowledge, unlike literal phrases. Let‚Äôs test this.\nThe Experiment\nI asked ChatGPT the following: ‚ÄúCan you use ‚Äòkick the bucket‚Äô in a sentence?‚Äù\nThe response: ‚ÄúAfter a long and happy life, the old sailor finally kicked the bucket.‚Äù This is a correct use of the idiom, meaning ‚Äúto die.‚Äù So far, so good.\nNext, I tested whether the model could recognize idiomatic misuse: ‚ÄúI was so thirsty, I kicked the bucket and drank all the water.‚Äù\nChatGPT corrected my usage: ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt quite fit. ‚ÄòKick the bucket‚Äô means to die, so if you‚Äôre thirsty, you might say ‚ÄòI was so thirsty, I drank the entire bottle of water.‚Äô‚Äù This suggests the model has a strong grasp of idioms, at least common ones.\nWhere It Falls Short\nHowever, when I tried a less common idiom‚Äî‚Äúspill the beans‚Äù‚Äîin a tricky sentence: ‚ÄúI love cooking, so I always spill the beans in my kitchen.‚Äù\nChatGPT didn‚Äôt flag this as incorrect and instead responded with: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great! Cooking is a wonderful skill to have.‚Äù This reveals an occasional gap: while the model recognizes widely used idioms, it sometimes fails to identify them in unusual or misleading contexts.\nFinal Takeaways LLMs are excellent at sensing and using idioms in conventional usage. But they still struggle with: - Rare idioms - Detecting idioms when the situation is complex or ambiguous\nAs AI models get better, maybe we will get more contextual intuition, but as things work out currently, idioms are one area where human instincts still enjoy a significant edge.\nWould you let AI make your next stand up comedy? Let me know what you think!"
