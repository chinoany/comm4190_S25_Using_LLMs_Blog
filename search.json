    "text": "Hi, welcome to my blog! I’m Chinomso Anyadiegwu, a student at the University of Pennsylvania studying Philosophy, Politics, and Economics with minors in Data Science and Legal Studies.\nOn my blog I test interesting use cases and applications of AI. From superbowl predictions to planning vacations. All of my posts are broken down into the four main parts. 1) The experiment 2) Prompts and outputs between the user and the LLM 3) Observations + Key Takeaways 4) Why does this matter.\nWorking on this blog pushed me to experiment with AI tools outside of just the way they function, but also how they shape ideas, storytelling, and ethics. If you have any questions feel free to email me!\nEmail: chinoany@sas.upenn.edu"

    "text": "Change a single word in your prompt and ChatGPT reshuffles tone, depth, and even moral framing. Below I run three quick “hands,” keeping everything constant except one tiny phrase, then examine how the model’s output changes!\n\n\n\nImage generated by ChatGPT!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel: GPT-4o\n\nExperiment: Start with a baseline prompt, then alter only one phrase per round. All other parameters remain the same.\n\n\n\n\n\nChanged word: explain -&gt; summarize\n\nFirst prompt: Explain climate change in exactly 150 words.\nGPT-4o chat response 1:\nClimate change refers to persistent shifts in Earth’s average temperature and weather regimes produced primarily by human-driven greenhouse-gas forcing. Burning coal, oil, and natural gas releases carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, which absorb outgoing infrared radiation and re-emit it downward, reducing the planet’s net energy loss to space. As the lower troposphere warms, feedback loops magnify the effect: warmer air holds more water vapour, melting sea ice lowers albedo, and thawing permafrost liberates methane. The ocean absorbs most excess heat, leading to thermal expansion and sea-level rise, while altered temperature gradients reposition jet streams and storm tracks. Consequences include longer heatwaves, intensified drought-flood cycles, and ecosystem disruption. Ice-core records, isotopic signatures, and satellite radiometry together confirm the anthropogenic signal and bound equilibrium climate sensitivity near three degrees Celsius per CO₂ doubling.\nSecond prompt: Summarize climate change in exactly 150 words.\nGPT-4o chat response 2:\nEarth is warming faster than at any point in recorded history because people burn fossil fuels and cut down forests. Carbon-dioxide, methane, and other gases form a heat-trapping layer around the planet, acting like an extra blanket that holds in energy normally released to space. The extra warmth melts glaciers, pushes seas higher, and super-charges storms, droughts, and wildfires. Oceans soak up about 90 % of the added heat, expanding as they warm and turning more acidic, which endangers coral reefs and fisheries. Poorer communities and low-lying nations, although least responsible for emissions, feel the earliest, hardest impacts. Scientists agree—based on ice cores, tree rings, satellite data, and modern instruments—that the rise in temperature since the Industrial Revolution is human-driven and that limiting warming to 1.5 °C will require cutting global emissions roughly in half by 2030.\n\nObservation: Both outputs meet the 150-word limit. However, explain gives a more mechanism heavy response (radiative forcing, feedbacks), whereas, Summarize uses general language to describe the consequences and moral framing.\n\n\n\n\nChanged phrase: “a 5-year-old” -&gt; “my college roommate”\n&gt; Third prompt: Explain climate change to a 5-year-old in under 80 words.\n&gt; GPT-4o chat response 3:\n&gt; Climate change means Earth is getting hotter because people use things like cars and factories that make dirty air. The dirty air acts like a big blanket around the planet, trapping heat. This makes weather act weird — like stronger storms, really hot days, and melting ice where polar bears live. If we take better care of Earth by using clean energy and planting trees, we can help keep it safe and happy! &gt; &gt; Fourth prompt: Explain climate change to my college roommate in under 80 words.\n&gt; GPT-4o chat response 4:\n&gt; Climate change is the long-term heating of Earth’s climate system due to human activities, mainly burning fossil fuels like oil, gas, and coal. This traps heat in the atmosphere, leading to rising temperatures, stronger storms, droughts, and rising sea levels. It’s not just about the planet getting warmer — it’s about ecosystems, economies, and our future stability being at risk if we don’t shift to cleaner energy and adapt quickly.\nObservation: Depending on the audience Chat edits its diction and metaphor use. The “5-year-old” respoonse uses blankets and feelings; the “roommate” version references sea-levels, emissions, and policy fixes (more appropriate for an older audience).\n\n\n\n\nCase 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanged set-up: “What causes” -&gt; “Who is to blame for”\n\nFifth prompt: What causes climate change? Give two key factors.\nGPT-4o chat response 5:\n1. Greenhouse-gas emissions from fossil fuels—Burning coal, oil, and natural gas releases CO₂, methane, and nitrous oxide that trap heat.\n2. Land-use change—Deforestation and industrial agriculture reduce carbon-sequestering vegetation and emit additional greenhouse gases.\nSixth prompt: Who is to blame for climate change? Give two key factors.\nGPT-4o chat response 6:\n1. High-income industrialized nations whose historical and current fossil-fuel use account for the majority of cumulative greenhouse-gas emissions.\n2. Large fossil-fuel corporations that continue extracting, lobbying, and advertising despite decades-old evidence of climate risk.\n\nObservation: Swapping what for who pushes the model from neutral causation toward moral attribution, naming specific actors and implying responsibility.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrompt verbs steer depth. Explain favors mechanism; summarize favors overview.\n\nAudience labels instantly retune register. Explaining the reader/audience removes the need to tweak the output by hand.\nFraming words can lead to bias. Using who vs. what can lead to value judgments.\nSmall edits ≠ small effects.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you treat prompts as insignificant, you may accidentally change the story your model tells, undermining brand voice, skewing analysis, or injecting unintended bias. Practicing “Prompt Poker” trains you to identify and deliberately use these hidden levers!"

Gemini translates to fit the meaning culturally, but when translating back to english it’s the same as it started off.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlgorithms are often used to translate (English → X → Y) due to resource gaps or cost. Each hop from language to language risks semantic drift, especially for idioms or less literal phrases that might not be able to directly translate to another language."

    "text": "I’m someone who loves to travel every chance I get, but planning a trip can feel like a second job! While staring at flight options for my next getaway, it realized I dont have to do all of this, AI exists! Why not hand the logistics over to AI? So I asked Google’s Gemini to design a one week solo vacation for me from scratch: flights, hotel/airbnb, things to do, etc. Here’s how Gemini did at playing full-service travel agent!\n\n\n\nsolguruz.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel: Google’s Gemini 2.0 Flash\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrompt:\nPlan a one-week trip for a 21 year old black female college student. My budget is 2000 including flights. I’m a US citizen.\n\n\nGemini’s Response 1: It sounds like you’re looking for an exciting and budget-friendly one-week trip! As a 21-year-old Black female college student, you’ll want a destination that’s safe, offers interesting experiences, and fits within your $2000 budget, including flights. Here are a few ideas focusing on destinations within the United States that can offer a fantastic week without breaking the bank:\nOption 1: New Orleans, Louisiana - Culture, Music, and Delicious Food\nWhy it’s great: New Orleans is a vibrant city with a unique blend of cultures, incredible live music (especially jazz!), delicious and affordable food, and a rich history. It’s also known for its friendly atmosphere. Things to do: Wander through the historic French Quarter, admiring the architecture and soaking in the lively atmosphere. Street performers are always entertaining! Listen to live jazz on Frenchmen Street – there are numerous clubs with affordable cover charges or free entry. Take a stroll through the beautiful Garden District and admire the stunning mansions. You can even do a self-guided walking tour. Indulge in the city’s famous cuisine: beignets at Cafe Du Monde, po’boys, gumbo, and jambalaya are must-tries and can be found at various price points. Consider a swamp tour to see alligators and learn about the unique Louisiana wetlands. Visit the New Orleans Museum of Art or the Backstreet Cultural Museum to learn about the city’s rich cultural heritage, including its African American history. Budget Considerations: Flights: Depending on your departure city, round-trip flights within the US can often be found for under $400-$500 if booked in advance and during off-peak times. Accommodation: Hostels are a budget-friendly option, with private rooms sometimes available. Look for options in areas like the Marigny or near the French Quarter. Budget hotels or Airbnb stays slightly outside the main tourist areas can also be affordable. Aim for around $50-$80 per night. Food: New Orleans offers many affordable food options, from casual eateries to food trucks. You can easily budget $30-$50 per day for delicious meals. Activities: Many attractions, like walking around the French Quarter and listening to street music, are free. Museums and tours have entrance fees, so prioritize what interests you most. Look for free events or discounted days. Transportation: The city is walkable in many areas. Public transportation (streetcars and buses) is also available and affordable. Option 2: Chicago, Illinois - Architecture, Museums, and City Life\nWhy it’s great: Chicago boasts stunning architecture, world-class museums, diverse neighborhoods, and a vibrant arts and culture scene. It’s a big city with plenty to explore without needing a car for everything. Things to do… (Very long output)\n\nObservation: It provided a lot of information… almost too much.

Possible Destinations within Portugal: Lisbon: A charming capital city with colorful buildings, historic neighborhoods (like Alfama and Bairro Alto), stunning viewpoints, and delicious pastries (pastel de nata!). Porto: Known for its port wine cellars, beautiful bridges, and historic Ribeira district along the Douro River. Budget Considerations: Flights: Flights to Portugal from the US can vary greatly. You might find round-trip options in the $500-$800 range, especially if you fly into larger hubs like Lisbon or Porto and are flexible. Accommodation: Hostels are a good budget option in both Lisbon and Porto (around $20-$40 per night). Budget guesthouses (pensões) and Airbnb rooms can also be found for reasonable prices ($40-$70 per night). Food: Eating at local tascas (small restaurants) can be very affordable and offers delicious traditional Portuguese food. Budget $30-$50 per day for food. Activities: Walking around the cities, exploring historic neighborhoods, and enjoying viewpoints are free. Public transportation is efficient and relatively inexpensive. Entrance fees to attractions are generally reasonable.\n\nObservation: I loved Option 3 because I’ve never been to Portugal so Lisbon would be a new experience for me.\n\n\n\n\n\nAffordable, photogenic city with English signage\nAfro-diaspora tour + Mozambican food = identity-aware choices (Gemini considered things I might like as an African-American)\nSafety tips on pickpockets, late-night rideshares. However, no mention of occasional anti-Black bias reports, would require personal research worth personal research.\nZero suggestions for hostel meet-ups or social apps if I want company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContext matters. Age, identity, and budget steered Gemini toward a culturally relevant, safe, and affordable city.\n\nAlmost book-ready. Only minor edits (visa reminder, bigger food cushion) separate this plan from purchase clicks.\n\nSafety nuance: decent, not deep. Petty-crime pointers are there; bias insights require human legwork.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven the most seasoned travelers still lose hours piecing together flights, lodgings, and daily routes. Gemini can cut that time to minutes, freeing people to focus on planning outfits and counting the days down till vacation!"

    "text": "Prompt:\nPlan a one-week trip for a 21 year old black female college student. My budget is 2000 including flights. I’m a US citizen.\n\n\nGemini’s Response 1: It sounds like you’re looking for an exciting and budget-friendly one-week trip! As a 21-year-old Black female college student, you’ll want a destination that’s safe, offers interesting experiences, and fits within your $2000 budget, including flights. Here are a few ideas focusing on destinations within the United States that can offer a fantastic week without breaking the bank:\nOption 1: New Orleans, Louisiana - Culture, Music, and Delicious Food\nWhy it’s great: New Orleans is a vibrant city with a unique blend of cultures, incredible live music (especially jazz!), delicious and affordable food, and a rich history. It’s also known for its friendly atmosphere. Things to do: Wander through the historic French Quarter, admiring the architecture and soaking in the lively atmosphere. Street performers are always entertaining! Listen to live jazz on Frenchmen Street – there are numerous clubs with affordable cover charges or free entry. Take a stroll through the beautiful Garden District and admire the stunning mansions. You can even do a self-guided walking tour. Indulge in the city’s famous cuisine: beignets at Cafe Du Monde, po’boys, gumbo, and jambalaya are must-tries and can be found at various price points. Consider a swamp tour to see alligators and learn about the unique Louisiana wetlands. Visit the New Orleans Museum of Art or the Backstreet Cultural Museum to learn about the city’s rich cultural heritage, including its African American history. Budget Considerations: Flights: Depending on your departure city, round-trip flights within the US can often be found for under $400-$500 if booked in advance and during off-peak times. Accommodation: Hostels are a budget-friendly option, with private rooms sometimes available. Look for options in areas like the Marigny or near the French Quarter. Budget hotels or Airbnb stays slightly outside the main tourist areas can also be affordable. Aim for around $50-$80 per night.

Accurate but maybe in the 90s. - “Dog-and-bone” for phone fits Cockney rhyming slang tradition.\n- The Gen-Z version doesn’t make much sense at all.

However, after checking, I saw that my favorite domain name actually wasn’t available!\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot from web.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond prompt: Five six-word-max taglines for HauteHound.\nGPT-4o chat response 2:\n1. “Elegance, Tailored for Every Tail.”\n2. “Luxury Walks on Four Legs.”\n3. “Unleash Sartorial Instincts.”\n4. “Where Canines Wear Couture.”\n5. “Style That Sits and Stays.”\n\nObservation: I really liked #5! “Style That Sits and Stays.” Chat took a playful approach which was interesting and added a nice touch to the slogans!\n\n\n\n\n\nThird prompt: Write a 120-word origin story in an elevated yet playful tone.\nGPT-4o chat response 3: West-African-trained designer Chino Anyadiegwu never went anywhere without her golden-doodles, Cocoa and Jaja, clothed in improvised silk scarves, her dogs drew more attention from photographers than the runway models she dressed. Realizing dogs deserve the same craftsmanship as humans, Chino stitched Cocoa and Jaja miniature cashmere winter “coats”.

Because sophistication shouldn’t stop at the leash.\n\nObservation: Chat incorporated the context I gave it well. (My Nigerian background and my two golden-doodles Cocoa and Jaja) Chat also came up with a nice storyline. Although this narrative isn’t completly true in my case. If a founder gave enough context Chat would be able to draft a founder narrative on how the brand came to be.\n\n\n\n\n\nFourth prompt: Describe a logo mark, color specs (HEX), and recommended typefaces.\nGPT-4o chat response 4:\n• Icon: Minimalist line-art dog in mid-stride wearing a flowing trench; negative-space “H” formed by leash arc.\n• Palette:\n- Rich Charcoal #222222 (primary)\n- Champagne Gold #DCC48E (accent for hardware & icon outline)\n- Pearl White #F7F7F5 (background)\n• Typography: Headlines in Didot (classic fashion feel); body copy in Montserrat (clean sans).\n\nObservation: Given a specific list of logo items, Chat was able to come up with a detailed logo concept for the brand.\n\n\n\n\n\nFifth prompt: Bullet three brand pillars and define the core buyer persona in ≤100 words.\nGPT-4o chat response 5:\n• Craft Couture: Italian fabrics, hand-finished seams, cruelty-free trims.\n• Canine Ergonomics: Patterns graded for unrestricted gait.\n• Sustainable Indulgence: Small-batch production; carbon-neutral shipping.\nPersona: Urban professionals (25-45) who treat pets as children, spend on designer wear, and signal eco-conscious values on social media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSixth prompt: Three Instagram captions (≤100 chars) to unveil HoundHaute.

Crafted in Paris, strutted worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n\n~5 min of model runtime + ~3 min of my reading/selection = comfortably under the 10-minute target.\n\n\n\n\n\nNames + URLs in a minute. Filtering for dot-com availability up-front avoids heartbreak later.\n\nEntire brands can be built overnight!. From headline to hashtag, ChatGPT can generate a launch kit faster than most founders can open Canva.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly stage teams burn days crafting names, debating fonts, and drafting the brands story. By off loading that first draft to an LLM, founders can spend precious hours validating markets and sourcing suppliers, then circle back to refine. Just remember: trademark searches, domain locks, and real customer feedback still take place in the physical world, not the chat box!"

    "text": "Spotify’s “Made for You” section promises to hand craft an album-like listening journey from billions of tracks. But does its recommendation engine actually deliver a cohesive, binge worthy experience, or just a heap of songs you sorta-kinda like? I spent my all-nighter during final season listening to one of Spotify’s AI-generated “Daily Mix” playlists, treating it as if it were a playlist i discovered online, then compared it to other playlists I listen to when studying.\n\n\n\nnewsroom.spotify.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection\nWhat It Does\nData Used\n\n\n\n\nCollaborative Filtering\nMatches you with similar users and surfaces their favorites.\nYour play history + global user matrix\n\n\nContent-Based Audio Analysis\nClusters tracks by tempo, key, valence, timbre.\nRaw audio features via Spotify’s Echo Nest models\n\n\nNatural-Language Processing\nScans blogs, reviews, and social posts to detect emerging buzz.\nWeb-scraped text embeddings\n\n\nContext Models\nAdjusts picks by time of day, device, recent skips.\nReal-time session data\n\n\n\nThe Daily Mix blends all four: first starting with your repeat listens, then adding in “serendipity tracks” that adjacent listeners love but you’ve never played.\n\n\n\nSpotify’s Recommendation Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA peek into my daily mix 2!\n\n\n\n\n5 being the highest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriteria\nNotes\nScore (1-5)\n\n\n\n\nCohesion\nIndie pop/rock blend with EDM (Electronic Dance Music)\n4.7\n\n\nDiscovery Factor\n5 of 50 songs completely new to me\n1\n\n\nSkip Rate\nSkipped 3 songs all others played through\n5\n\n\n\nOverall Impression: I enjoyed listening to this playlist while getting work done. However, I knew and frequently listen to over 90% of the songs on this mix. I wish I discovered new songs that I love.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI nails personal taste. Most songs matched my existing library or immediate likes.\n\nEasier to Discover New Music In some ways it makes it easier to discover 2-3 new songs, not many but still something.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs streaming replaces albums, algorithms are becoming personal DJs. Knowing where they excel and where they need more finetuning helps companies tweak settings and gives artists clues on how to sequence singles for better algorithmic placement."

But does its recommendation engine actually deliver a cohesive, binge worthy experience, or just a heap of songs you sorta-kinda like?

    "text": "Could an LLM stand in as junior counsel? Spotting issues, drafting arguments, and citing precedent. I gave Gemini a mock slip and fall lawsuit and watched it perform basic lawyer tasks.\n\n\n\n\nwww.martindale-avvo.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel: Google’s Gemini 2.0 Flash\n\nExperiment:\n\nCase: Grocery-store customer slipped on spilled olive oil; claims negligence.\nJurisdiction: New York state court (tort law + CPLR).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst prompt: List and briefly analyze every potential cause of action and defense in this fact pattern. Limit to 250 words.\n\n\nGemini chat response 1:\nOkay, let’s break down the potential legal avenues in this spilled olive oil scenario:\nPotential Causes of Action (Plaintiff - Customer):\nNegligence: The primary claim, as discussed, alleging the store failed in its duty to maintain a safe environment, leading to the slip and fall. Success hinges on proving duty, breach (notice of spill crucial), causation, and damages.   Premises Liability: This isn’t a separate cause of action in New York but rather the specific area of negligence law governing landowners’ responsibilities to those on their property. The analysis remains the same as general negligence but focuses on the store’s role as a property owner. Potential Defenses (Defendant - Grocery Store):\nLack of Notice: Arguing they had no actual or constructive knowledge of the spill and thus no opportunity to remedy it. Open and Obvious Condition: Claiming the spill was readily visible, and the customer should have avoided it, potentially leading to a finding of comparative negligence. Comparative Negligence: Asserting the customer’s own carelessness contributed to the fall (e.g., not paying attention), reducing their potential recovery under New York’s pure comparative fault rule.\nNo Causation: Arguing the slip and fall wasn’t directly caused by the olive oil (unlikely given the facts, but theoretically possible). Failure to Mitigate Damages: If applicable, arguing the customer failed to take reasonable steps to minimize their injuries. The strength of each will depend heavily on the specific details of the incident.\n\nObservation: Gemini gives a clean, readable outline that would help guide a junior associate, but it feels like a high-level sketch rather than a comprehensive checklist.\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond prompt: Draft a CPLR 3211(a)(7) motion to dismiss, 400 words, including point headings and a demand for costs\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot from Gemini Conversation\n\n\nObservation: Interestingly Gemini started to give me a response then mid way trough generation, said it couldnt provide an answer!\n\n\n\n\n\nThird prompt: Cite precedent\n\n\nGemini chat response 3:\nOkay, here’s an updated version of the CPLR 3211(a)(7) motion to dismiss, now with added citations to relevant precedent.\n\n\nfrom IPython.display import IFrame, display\nimport base64, pathlib\n\npdf_path = pathlib.Path(\"CPLR 3211(a)(7) Motion to Dismiss.pdf\")\n\ndata = base64.b64encode(pdf_path.read_bytes()).decode()\n\ndisplay(IFrame(f\"data:application/pdf;base64,{data}\", width=900, height=550))\n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n\nImportant Notes:\nAdaptation: This is a template. You’ll need to adapt it to the specifics of the case (names, dates, factual details from the Complaint). Jurisdiction: The cited cases are New York cases and apply specifically to New York law. Local Rules: Be sure to check the local rules of the specific court where the case is pending, as those rules may contain additional requirements for motion practice. I have aimed to include the most important elements of a CPLR 3211(a)(7) motion to dismiss and have cited relevant New York precedent. Remember, this is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. You should always consult with a qualified attorney to address the specifics of your situation.\n\nObservation: Gemini produced credible, real citations and avoided hallucinating new ones, but it didn’t actually summarize the holdings, so the response only half met the prompt. It’s a good first draft.\n\n\n\n\nNo new hallucinations – the phantom fake precendent case is gone (https://www.yahoo.com/news/attorney-pleads-mercy-using-ai-110052528.html)\nMissing holdings\nLooks good but is light on substance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLLMs can draft usable first draft documents in minutes, probably great for solo attorneys or clinic students racing deadlines. However, fabricated citations or missed issues could instantly burn a case. AI is valuable for brainstorming but shouldnt be trusted without human review."
